# flutter_auto_gui

A flutter plugin for desktop applications for controlling mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications. This plugin is highly inspired by the [PyAutoGui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) python package and [RobotJs](http://robotjs.io/) and as such tries to mimic most of the available methods.
